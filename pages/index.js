            GM, I'm Noble. I'm a versatile software professional with four years
            of maintenance and development experience. I've worked hard to
            design multiple applications and microservices using AWS services,
            Cloudflare, and Kafka in addition to establishing competence in
            typescript, Python, and the Django framework. I am a valuable and
            dependable software professional thanks to my active abilities in
            application development, debugging, problem diagnosis & problem
            solving, and project management.
